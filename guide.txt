STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO DEPLOY A VITE REACT APP ON GITHUB:


Step 1: Create a new folder and open it in VS Code.

Step 2: Open the terminal in VS Code and write the following commands to create a new Vite App:

            npm create vite@latest

- Enter your Project Name (e.g. my-vite-app)
- Choose React by using the arrow keys
- Choose JavaScript by using the arrow keys

- Now go to the project folder:

            cd my-vite-app

- Then install the packages:

            npm install

- And here you go, your project is live on your localhost! 
- Run this command and click on the link to have a look on your Vite Project: 

            npm run dev

Step 3: Open your GitHub account and create a new repository, give your repository a name and click on "Create Repository".

Step 4: Now come back to your VS Code project and run these commands:

- Initialize git:

            git init 

- Stage all the changes in the current directory:

            git add .

- Save the staged changes as a new version in the project's history with a message "add: initial files": 

            git commit -m "add: initial files" 

- Rename the current branch to "main" in Git:

            git branch -M main 

- Set up a new remote repository for your local Git respository by creating a remote named "origin" and associate it with the URL (of the repository where you want to push your code):

            git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME] 

- Push the committed changes from your local "main" branch to the "main" branch on the remote repository named "origin":

            git push -u origin main

- Now, after refreshing your GitHub Page, you will see your directories and files in that repository.

Step 5: Now, in VS Code Project, in the "vite.config.js" file, setup base by adding:

            base: "/[REPO_NAME]/"

Step 6: Create a folder named ".github", in that folder, create another folder named "workflows" and inside that folder, create a new file "deploy.yml" and paste the exact code below:

            name: Deploy
            on:
            push:
                branches:
                - main
            jobs:
            build:
                name: Build
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                steps:
                - name: Checkout repo
                    uses: actions/checkout@v2
                - name: Setup Node
                    uses: actions/setup-node@v1
                    with:
                    node-version: 16
                - name: Install dependencies
                    uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1
                - name: Build project
                    run: npm run build
                - name: Upload production-ready build files
                    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
                    with:
                    name: production-files
                    path: ./dist
            deploy:
                name: Deploy
                needs: build
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
                steps:
                - name: Download artifact
                    uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
                    with:
                    name: production-files
                    path: ./dist
                - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
                    uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
                    with:
                    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                    publish_dir: ./dist

Step 7: Now push it to GitHub by running the following commannds:

            git add . 
            git commit -m "add: deploy workflow" 
            git push

Step 8: Now go to your GitHub repository.

- Go to:    

Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions > Read and write permissions > Save

- Now go to Actions, wait for a while while the process is going on. 
- There will be an error in the deploy process!

- Then go to:    

Build > Re-run jobs > Re-run failed jobs  

- Now go to:     

Settings > Pages > Build and Deployment > Branch > Select gh-pages > Save


- And it's done!!
- Your Vite Project is deployed on GitHub.
- After refreshing your page, you can see something like this: Your site is live at https://[USERNAME].github.io/[REPO_NAME]/
- You can add this link to your repository's About section and see your live website by clicking on that link.


- If you did any changes to your code, then just push it to GitHub, it'll deploy automaatically:

            git add . 
            git commit -m "fix: some bug" 
            git push



HAPPY CODING!!
